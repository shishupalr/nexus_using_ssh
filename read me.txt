this is the step to configure nexus server on remote host
Tech used -
Shell script (for writing the instrution )
ansible playbook(for deployment and execution )

Important thing while making this file here 
I have created one dir named nexus to store all neccecary data 

File creation section
create one file at ansible host machine to replace the file at remote machine

/home/ansible/nexus/nexus.rc ----->>>copy the content from nexus.rc file as uploded
/home/ansible/nexus/nexus.vmoption ---->>>copy the content from nexus.vmoption file as uploded 
other file
/home/ansibel/nexus/nexus.sh 

Ansible

create a host entry in ansible directort let say user
and add detail as follow
<remote_ip>  ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root
 
create two diffrent playbook one for coping content and another to excute shell script
--playbook is also uploded as nexusplaybook
I have used nexuscopy playbook to copy the configered file and and  named nexus.yml for executing the script

I have used this command for execution 
ansible-playbook -i user /home/jenkins/ansible/nexus/nexuscopy.yml -k -u root
ansible-playbook -i user /home/jenkins/ansible/nexus/nexus.yml -k -u root


here you shoud know remote user(i.e root ) password for excution
